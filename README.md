Dynamic Mode Decomposition to Characterize Chemical Reactor Mixing

Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a dimensionality reduction technique that can pull out spatiotemporal structures in time series data. This algorithm is particularly powerful in modeling fluid flows with non-linear dynamics. The notebook in this repo covers the DMD algorithm and how it might be applied to chemical reactor mixing.
